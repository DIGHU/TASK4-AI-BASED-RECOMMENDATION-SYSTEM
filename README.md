# TASK4-AI-BASED-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

 * Company:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

* Name: Dirghayush Umakant Sogale

* Intern ID: CITS0D178

 * Domain: Artificial Intelligence / Recommendation Systems

* Duration: 4 Weeks

* Mentor: Neela Santosh

*  DESCRIPTION OF TASK:

The aim of this task was to build a basic AI-based recommendation system that can suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences. The recommendation engine demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and data processing to analyze user behavior and provide intelligent suggestions.
In this project, I implemented a content-based filtering model using Python. The system used a dataset (for example, a list of movies with features like genre, rating, and keywords). The model computed similarity between items using the cosine similarity metric based on text feature vectors.

The core steps involved in this task included:

* Reading and preprocessing the dataset using pandas.
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization or CountVectorizer.
* Calculating similarity scores.
* Taking user input (like favorite movie) and recommending top similar items.

This project helped me:

* Understand how AI is used in building personalized systems.
* Learn about vectorization and similarity computation in recommendation engines.
* Practice Python libraries like scikit-learn,pandas and numpy.
* Develop a small-scale prototype that mimics functionality found in Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube recommendation models.

This task demonstrated the value of AI in modern software systems by showcasing how intelligent recommendations improve user experience.
